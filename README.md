## Description

**The goal of the game is to systematically push some of**\
**the button (in our case, cells)until every light is turned off, winning the game.**

Lights Out is a game produced by Tiger Electronics consisting of a 5 by 5 \
grid of buttons, each of which can be either lit up or turned off. Each game \
begins with some of the buttons turned on, or lit. Pressing a button changes \
the status of that button- i.e., off to on or on to off- as well as the status of \
each its neighbors (top, bottom, left and right).
